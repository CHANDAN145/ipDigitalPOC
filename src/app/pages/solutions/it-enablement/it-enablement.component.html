                        The hyper-connected millennial workforce is more empowered and enabled than ever
                        before by virtue of cloud and mobile technologies. They expect to work seamlessly from
                        anywhere without compromising on productivity, necessitating the IT service desk to
                        support a diverse range of technologies and platforms. Additionally, IT service desks are
                        expected to deliver a high degree of personalization, convenience, and speed; a failure in
                        this regard will adversely affect employee motivation and performance, and Field Service
                        Management (FSM) as well. IP Digital manages IT service desk contacts annually, for a lot
                        of customers, thereby creating new age workplaces and providing helpdesk support
                        services. Further more, our automation based framework on Windows migration as
                        Windows 8/Windows 10 provides consistent user experience across multiple devices.
                        Consequently, organizations can reap the benefits of increased efficiency through
                        automation, pre-emptive resolution of issues, and accelerated Windows migration to
                        Windows 8.

                        At IPDigital, we also realize that modern day organizations grapple with the challenges of
                        Managed Print Services (MPS) and Field Service Management - optimizing printer fleets
                        and creating field service support capabilities across the globe. Our solution incorporates
                        rigorous processes, a phased implementation strategy, and innovative technology.
                        Organizations will benefit from proactive and intelligent support, reduced waste, and
                        automated paper-based processes.
